###neXt Motion Engine (XME)

The neXt Motion Engine is a system that enables haptic feedback. It's specifically designed for the subwoofer, which creates a vibration thanks to low frequencies.

I got this idea from Apple's Taptic Engine, which provides vibrations that are both fast and quite precise. Since the subwoofer could also achieve this when used correctly, I wanted to test it here.

##Features

- Play a specific frequency for a set duration and volume.

- Allow acceleration or deceleration from one frequency and volume to another within a given time.

- Play a dotted rhythm at a specified frequency, volume, interval between notes, and repetitions.

- Play a waveform with an initial frequency, two peak frequencies, and an end frequency for a specified time period.

- Thanks to the asynchronous method, other tasks are not affected and run in parallel.

##Demo - Motion Engine

This demo is designed to showcase the features and application of the neXt Motion Engine.

I may also include the option to change values ​​in the demo app without touching the code, so that those who are simply interested but lack the necessary tools can still grasp the concept.

##Requirements

The system requires a subwoofer to generate the vibrations. The more powerful the subwoofer, the better the feedback.

I personally tested it with a simple 2.1 system with an external subwoofer for PCs.

For some setups, different frequencies might be more effective than the preset ones.

A one-time calibration will be available at some point.
